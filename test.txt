I met a real estate agent once. He told me he could help me find my dream house. I followed him to where he said it was. I saw the house and I really loved it! I asked the agent for the price. It was very expensive. I could not afford it. I tried to negotiate but he wouldn't. He said that house prices go up over time and I should buy the house now. I told him I did not have enough money. I called my wife and asked her to come see the house. She arrived within the hour and saw the house. She loved it! I told her about the price. She looked at me and smiled. My wife paid for the house.
